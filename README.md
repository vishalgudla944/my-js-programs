# my-js-programs
This repository contains a collection of JavaScript programs that I developed while learning, practicing, and teaching JavaScript as a part of the App and Web Development Club at KGRCET. These programs cover a wide range of topics â€” from basic scripting and DOM manipulation to simple projects and browser-based logic.
